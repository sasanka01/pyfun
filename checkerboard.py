# Assignment: Checkerboard
# Write a program that prints a 'checkerboard' pattern to the console.
#
# Your program should require no input and produce console output that looks like so:
#
# * * * *
#  * * * *
# * * * *
#  * * * *
# * * * *
#  * * * *
# * * * *
#  * * * *
# Copy
# Each star or space represents a square. On a traditional checkerboard you'll see alternating squares of red or black. In our case we will alternate stars and spaces. The goal is to repeat a process several times. This should make you think of looping.

for i in range(1, 9):
        if(i%2==0):
            output = " *" * 4
        else:
            output = "* " * 4
        print output
